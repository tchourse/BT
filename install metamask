### **Step 1: Install MetaMask**

#### **For Chrome, Brave, Firefox, or Edge (using a browser):**
1. **Open your browser** and go to the official MetaMask website:  
   [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
   
2. **Click on “Download”**:  
   On the homepage, click the **Download** button.

3. **Select your browser**:  
   Choose **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Brave**, or **Edge**.

4. **Add MetaMask to your browser**:  
   - For Chrome, click **Add to Chrome**.
   - For other browsers, follow similar steps to add MetaMask as an extension.

### **Step 2: Create a MetaMask Wallet**

1. **Click on the MetaMask icon** in your browser's toolbar to open it.

2. **Click “Get Started”** to begin.

3. **Click “Create a Wallet”**.

4. **Set a strong password** to protect your wallet on your device.

5. **Backup your recovery phrase**:
   - MetaMask will show you a **12-word recovery phrase**. Write this down on paper and store it safely (this is essential for recovering your wallet).

6. **Confirm your recovery phrase**:  
   MetaMask will ask you to select the words in the correct order to verify you’ve written them down properly.

### **Step 3: Add Ether (ETH) to Your Wallet**

1. **Find your wallet address**:  
   After creating your wallet, you'll see your **Ethereum address** at the top (it starts with `0x...`).

2. **Send Ether to your MetaMask address**:
   - From another wallet or exchange, send ETH to the address shown in MetaMask.
   - You can copy and paste the address or scan the QR code.

3. **Alternatively, buy ETH directly in MetaMask**:
   - MetaMask offers third-party services to buy ETH directly via a debit/credit card (using services like Transak or MoonPay).

### **Step 4: Sending Ether and Studying Gas Fees**

1. **Click “Send”** in MetaMask to make a transaction.

2. **Enter the recipient’s address**:  
   Type or paste the Ethereum address of the person you’re sending ETH to.

3. **Enter the amount of ETH**:  
   Specify how much ETH you want to send.

4. **Review the Gas Fee**:  
   MetaMask will automatically show you the **gas fee**. Gas fees are the cost for processing the transaction on the Ethereum network.
   
   - **Gas Price**: Price per unit of gas, typically measured in **Gwei** (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH).
   - **Gas Limit**: The maximum gas that the transaction will use. For a simple ETH transfer, this is usually 21,000 gas.

5. **Study the Total Transaction Cost**:  
   - **Gas Fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price**
   - Example: If the **Gas Price** is 50 Gwei and the **Gas Limit** is 21,000, the total transaction fee will be 0.00105 ETH.

6. **Confirm the transaction**:  
   After reviewing, click **“Confirm”** to send the transaction. MetaMask will show you the **estimated gas fee** and how much ETH you’re spending on the transaction.

### **Step 5: Monitor Gas Fees and Transaction Status**

1. **Transaction Status in MetaMask**:
   - MetaMask will show your transaction status as **“Pending”** while it is being processed.
   - Once confirmed, the status will change to **“Confirmed”**.

2. **Track on Etherscan**:
   - Click the **transaction link** in MetaMask to view the details on **Etherscan**.
   - On Etherscan, you can check:
     - The **gas used** for the transaction.
     - The **gas price** at the time.
     - The **total fee** spent on the transaction.

---

### **Summary of Gas Fee Calculation**

- **Gas Fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price**
- For example:  
  - **Gas Limit** = 21,000 (standard for ETH transfer).
  - **Gas Price** = 50 Gwei (can vary based on network congestion).
  - Total Gas Fee = 21,000 × 50 Gwei = **1,050,000 Gwei = 0.00105 ETH**

---

### **Step 6: Tools for Monitoring Gas Prices**

- **ETH Gas Station**: Check current gas prices at [https://ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info).
- **Etherscan Gas Tracker**: Visit [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) to see live gas prices.
