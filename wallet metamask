3. **Buy Cryptocurrency Directly** (optional):  
   - You can also buy **ETH** or **other tokens** directly from MetaMask by using third-party services like **Transak** or **MoonPay**.
   - Follow the instructions in MetaMask to complete the purchase.

### **Security Tips for Your MetaMask Wallet**

- **Keep your recovery phrase safe**:  
   Store your recovery phrase offline (e.g., on paper) in a secure place. Never share it with anyone.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  
   Although MetaMask itself doesn't support 2FA, if you use exchanges or services to interact with your wallet, always enable 2FA to secure your accounts.

- **Be cautious of phishing attempts**:  
   Always double-check website URLs before entering your MetaMask credentials. Only use trusted sites to avoid scams.
